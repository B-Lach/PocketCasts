# Pocket Casts for Mac

I love Pocket Casts, it's my favorite Podcast Client on iOS and I appreciate the availablility  of the web app. But, I don't like to open a Browser. That's why I've build this Wrapper.

In a nutshell, it's just a NSWindow displaying an instance of WKWebView.

If the player is visible, it's possible to use the Media Keys (play/pause, rewind, fast forward) on the keyboard - even if the app is in background.

Having another application playing audio at the same time is not handled. Maybe a feature for a future version.
